Variables are temporary locations that we use to store data of different types; however, they can only store 1 type at a time. We always declare the variables type, then give it a name, after that we can assign it a value on the same line as the declaration or assign it a value later on a separate line; both yield the same structure. See the table below for the most commonly used primitive types and their declaration/initialization/assignment.
